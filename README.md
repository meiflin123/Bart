# react-bart
This is a solo project I completed as a student at hackreactor. It's a full-stack application that implements several features of an app to help people navigate the SF Bay Area's BART transportation network, similar to the [Moovit](https://moovitapp.com) app. 

### app features:
1. A **Lines** view that allows the user to </br>
   choose a BART line from a list and see all the stops along that line, </br>
   identify favorite stations with a star emoji,</br>
   remove a station from favorite stations. </br>

2. A **Trip Planner** that allows the user to </br>
   select origin and destination stations from a list of all stations, </br>
   see favorite stations at the top of the station lists so users don't have to scroll very far in order to locate them, </br>
   see a set of directions that are from origin to destination stations. </br>
   see routes (i.e., direct routes with no transfers, routes with transfers). </br>
