# react-bart
This is a solo project I completed as a student at hackreactor. It's a full-stack application that implements several features of an app to help people navigate the SF Bay Area's BART transportation network, similar to the [Moovit](https://moovitapp.com) app. 

### app features:

1. A **Lines** view that allows the user to choose a BART line from a list and see all the stops along that line, </br>
   and also allows user to click on a station name to be favorite station indicating with a star emoji or to remove a station  from favorite stations. </br>

2. A **Trip Planner** that allows the user to see a series of directions between two stations.</br>
