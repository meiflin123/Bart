# react-bart
This is a solo project I completed as a student at hackreactor. It's a full-stack application that implements several features of an app to help people navigate the SF Bay Area's BART transportation network, similar to the [Moovit](https://moovitapp.com) app. 

### app features:

1. A **Lines** view that allows the user to choose a BART line from a list and see all the stops along that line. </br>
2. A **Trip Planner** that allows the user to see a series of directions between two stations.</br>


### info:
react js, mysql.
